# Radioactive decay of Bismuth

### In this project I performed a simulation of the decay process of bismuth 213, which is a radioactive isotope of bismuth. It is possible to observe that in an intermediate process there is also the emergence of other atomic types, which, because they are unstable, also decay, until all atoms are converted into bismuth 209, which is stable.
